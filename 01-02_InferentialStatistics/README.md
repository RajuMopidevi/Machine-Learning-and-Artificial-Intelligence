    1. Basics of Probability
        1. Introduction: Inferential Statistics
            - Process of “inferring” insights from sample data is called “Inferential Statistics”.
        2. Random Variables
            - The **random variable X** basically converts outcomes of experiments to something measurable
        3. Probability Distributions - I
            - The three-step process for this is:
                1. Find all the possible combinations
                2. Find the probability of each combination
                3. Use the probabilities to estimate the profit/loss per player
            - Probability = $\frac{Favourable Outcomes}{Total Outcomes}$
        4. Probability Distributions - II
            - A **probability distribution** is ANY form of representation that tells us the probability for all possible values of X
        6. Expected Value - I
            - The **expected value** for a variable X is the value of X we would “expect” to get after performing the experiment once. It is also called **the expectation**, **average**, and **mean value**
            - the expected value (EV) is given by: $EV(X) = x_1 * P(X=x_1) + x_2 * P(X=x_2) + x_3 * P(X=x_3) + . . . . . + x_n * P(X=x_n) $
