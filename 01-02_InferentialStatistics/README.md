### Inferential Statistics
2. Inferential Statistics
    1. Basics of Probability
        1. Introduction: Inferential Statistics
            - Process of “inferring” insights from sample data is called “Inferential Statistics”.
        2. Random Variables
            - The **random variable X** basically converts outcomes of experiments to something measurable
        3. Probability Distributions - I
            - The three-step process for this is:
                1. Find all the possible combinations
                2. Find the probability of each combination
                3. Use the probabilities to estimate the profit/loss per player
        4. Probability Distributions - II
