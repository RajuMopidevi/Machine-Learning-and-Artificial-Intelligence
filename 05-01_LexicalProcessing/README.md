    1. Introduction to NLP
        1. Introduction
            - Text analytics(NLP) plays a very vital role in today’s era because of the sheer volume of text data that users generate around the world on digital channels such as social media apps, e-commerce websites, blog posts, etc
        2. NLP: Areas of Application
            1. Social Media Analytics
            2. Banking and loan Processing
            3. Insurance claim processing
            4. Customer relationship processing
            5. Security and counter-terrorism
            6. Computational social science

            * **Lexical Processing**: 
                - convert the raw text --> words --> sentences or paragraphs
                - In general, we can consider all plural words to be equivalent to the singular form.
                - Lexical processing will treat the two sentences as equal if the “group of words” in both sentences are the same.
            * **Syntactic Processing**:
                - Instead of only looking at the words, we look at the syntactic structures, i.e., the grammar of the language
                - Ex: Differentiating between the subject and the object of the sentence, i.e., identifying who is performing the action and who is the person affected by it
                - A question answering system. Ex: Who is the Prime Minister of India?
            * **Semantic Processing**: 
                - Lexical and syntactic processing don't suffice when it comes to building advanced NLP applications such as language translation.
                - inferring the word’s meaning to the collection of words that usually occur around it.
                - Understand other semantic relations. Ex: King and Queen are related. Both of these words can be clubbed under the word “Monarch”
            * Most of the applications, lexical and semantic processing simply form the “pre-processing” layer of the overall process.
